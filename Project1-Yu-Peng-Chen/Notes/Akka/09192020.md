* future: parallel execution

# Developers
(JAVA)
* implementation of concurrent, distributed applications
* Akka
  * a toolkit and runtime
  * on JVM
  * written in Scala
  * Actor model
    * Everything is an actor (object)
    * designed to serve as a concurrent model
    * message passing
      * share information with one another
    * Akka creates a layer between __the actors__ and __the underlying system__
      * actors simply need to process messages
    * *Reactive application*
      * event-driven
        * handles requests asynchronously 
      * scalable
        * adding nodes without modifying the code
          * message passing and location transparency
      * resilient
        * fault tolerance strategies: self-healing system
      * responsive
        * give quick feedback to the user
        * Akka's non-blocking, message-based strategy helps
* Actor
  * an object that receives messages and takes actions to handle them
  * decoupled from the source of the message
  * recognize the __type__ of message
  * *Upon receiving a message*
    * execute some operations
    * forward the message
    * instantiate a new actor
    * ignore the message
  * __implementation__
    * extend Actor
    * implement the receive method

# Mikhail Shilkov
* Actor
  * an actor is a container for *State*, *Behavior*, a *Mailbox*, *Children* and a *Supervisor Strategy*
  * knows what kind of messages it can accept
  * process messages
  * holds some state which is changed during message processing
  * potentially changes its behavior based on the current state
  * *creates and stores references to child actors*
  * obtain references to other actors
  * send messages to children and other actors
* questions
  * how to make the code easily testable
  * how to minimize the usage of mutable state
* Functional Actors
  * functions are easy to reason about, reusable, and testable
  * __define the required actor behavior in terms of a minimal function, and then use creational patterns to spawn actor instances out of it__
* Message Sink
  * stateless: *processing of each message is always the same*
  * it receives a message and executes some action on it.
