# COP5615 Fall 2020 Project 1 
  * Name: Yu-Peng Chen
  * UFID: 70943193
# Environment Setup
  * Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS
  * Processor: Intel® Core™ i5-9300H CPU @ 2.40GHz × 8 
  * __Steps__
    * Install the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
    * Install the [Ionide-fsharp extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ionide.Ionide-fsharp)
    * *Also did the following steps (but these do not seem to be necessary for this project)* :thinking:
      * run ```dotnet new console --language F#```
      * run ```dotnet add package Akka.FSharp --version 1.4.10```
# Command Line
  * ```dotnet fsi --langversion:preview proj1.fsx N k```
  * Report time:
    * ```time dotnet fsi --langversion:preview proj1.fsx N k```

# Report
  * Size of the work unit
    * __Number of workers: 8__
    * Size of work unit is decided by __dividing N by 8 (Number of workers)__, and the remainder goes to the last worker
      * For example, when N = 100, 100/8 = 12,
        * worker 1 gets the tasks starting with _1 to 12_
        * worker 2 gets the tasks starting with _13 to 24_
        * ...
        * worker 7 gets the tasks starting with _73 to 84_
        * worker 8 gets the tasks starting with _85 to 96_ plus the tasks starting with _97 to 100_
    * Explanation: the implementation was determined by trial and error.
  * The result of running this program for ```dotnet fsi --langversion:preview proj1.fsx 1000000 4```
    * __Found nothing__ for N = 1000000, k = 4

  * The running time of running this program for ```dotnet fsi --langversion:preview proj1.fsx 1000000 4```
    * | Type | Time |
      | ---- | ---- |
      | real | 0m5.229s |
      | user | 0m6.251s |
      | sys  | 0m0.521s |
    * See above image
    * **CPU time** to **real time** ratio = 1.2
  * The largest problem I managed to solve
    * ```dotnet fsi --langversion:preview proj1.fsx 100000000 2```
    * ![Result](https://github.com/ypchen520/UF-COP5615-DOS/blob/master/Project1-Yu-Peng-Chen/Images/result-100000000-2.png)
    * **CPU time** to **real time** ratio = 2.2
